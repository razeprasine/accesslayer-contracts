# Access Layer Contracts

This repository contains the on-chain smart contracts for Access Layer on Stellar using Soroban.

These contracts hold the trust-sensitive marketplace rules. The goal is to keep pricing, ownership, and fee logic on-chain while leaving general application features to the server and client.

## Purpose

The contracts layer is responsible for:

- registering creators on-chain
- minting and burning creator keys
- enforcing bonding curve pricing
- handling buy and sell execution
- distributing creator and protocol fees
- exposing ownership and supply state to the app

## Tech

- Rust
- Soroban SDK
- Stellar

## Workspace layout

- [Cargo.toml](./Cargo.toml): Rust workspace configuration
- [creator-keys](./creator-keys): first Soroban contract crate

## Current state

The initial `creator-keys` contract is only a starting point. It currently supports:

- simple creator registration
- a basic purchase action that increments creator supply
- reading stored creator data

## Verification

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

## Testnet deployment

For contributor test deployments and release checks, use the guide in [docs/stellar-testnet-deployment.md](./docs/stellar-testnet-deployment.md). Store and name release wasm files using [docs/deploy-artifacts.md](./docs/deploy-artifacts.md). For client and server integration expectations (read methods, events, version bumps), see [docs/contract-consumer-boundaries.md](./docs/contract-consumer-boundaries.md). For detailed return value semantics of every read-only entrypoint (units, precision, edge-case outputs), see [docs/read-only-methods.md](./docs/read-only-methods.md). For contract event naming conventions and topic format, see [docs/contract-event-conventions.md](./docs/contract-event-conventions.md). For quote-related storage key behavior and invariants, see [docs/quote-storage-keys.md](./docs/quote-storage-keys.md). For caller restrictions and the authorization model for each public function, see [docs/authorization-model.md](./docs/authorization-model.md).
