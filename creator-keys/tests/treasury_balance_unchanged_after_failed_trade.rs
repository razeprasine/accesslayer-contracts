//! Regression test: protocol treasury balance unchanged after a failed trade (#371).
//!
//! Protocol fees are credited to the treasury only on the success path of
//! `buy_key` / `sell_key`. When a trade fails, no fee — not even a partial one —
//! may reach the treasury. These tests record the read-only treasury balance
//! before a trade that is expected to fail, trigger the failing trade, and
//! assert the balance is identical afterward, covering both a buy failure and a
//! sell failure.
