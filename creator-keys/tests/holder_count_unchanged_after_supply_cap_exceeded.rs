//! Regression test: holder count unchanged after a failed buy due to supply cap exceeded.
//!
//! When a buy reverts because it would exceed the creator's supply cap, the holder
//! count must remain unchanged. A new wallet that did not previously hold keys must
//! not be added to the holder count just because a buy attempt was made and reverted.
