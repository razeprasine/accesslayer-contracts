//! Regression test: buyback quote cost must match the execution-path cost.
//!
//! The creator-facing buyback flow uses the same fixed-price fee math as the
//! existing exit path, so this test snapshots the quote, executes the matching
//! state change, and asserts the quoted cost equals the actual charged amount
//! at two different supply levels.
