//! Shared setup helpers for `creator-keys` integration tests.
//!
//! Compose the small functions here instead of one monolithic setup so each test
//! can opt in only to what it needs (pricing without fees, fees, registered creators, etc.).
//!
//! For the minimum test categories and example structures when adding new entrypoints,
//! see `docs/minimum-viable-test-structure.md` in the repo root.
//!
//! Not every integration-test binary uses every helper; this crate is compiled once per
//! `tests/*.rs` target, so we allow dead code at module scope.
