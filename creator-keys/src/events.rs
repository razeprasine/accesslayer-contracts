//! Centralized event names and helpers for consistent event emission.
//!
//! This module provides a single source of truth for event names used throughout
//! the contract, reducing string duplication and ensuring consistency across
//! event emission paths.
//!
//! ### Event Schema Stability
//!
//! Downstream indexers rely on the stable ordering of fields in event payloads.
//! When modifying event structures:
//! - **Do not reorder** existing fields.
//! - **Add new fields** only at the end of the structure to maintain compatibility.
//! - **Avoid removing fields**; if a field is deprecated, keep it with a default value.
//!
//! This approach ensures that indexers can reliably parse event data across
//! different contract versions.
//!
//! ### Quote-Related Event Field Semantics
//!
//! - `supply`: Number of keys in circulation after the trade (for buy/sell events)
//! - `payment`: Total amount paid by the buyer (for buy events, ≥ key price)
